VitaPong
==================

This is a classic pong clone I created as a throwback to the
origin of video games.

This is also my first homebrew game and
I designed it to resemble the original Pong by Ralph Baer.

The audio used in this homebrew comes from this page: http://cs.au.dk/~dsound/DigitalAudio.dir/Greenfoot/Pong.dir/Pong.html
